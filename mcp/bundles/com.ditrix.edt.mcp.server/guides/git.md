Run a git command in a project's repository through the real `git` CLI - the non-UI equivalent of typing it in a terminal. You send the command as a shell-style string; the tool parses it, accepts only a safe whitelist of subcommands, and runs `git` with a clean argument vector (never through a shell).

## Parameters
- `projectName` (**required**) - the EDT project whose git repository to run in. The repository is resolved the same way as `list_git_branches` (an EGit-shared project or a plain `.git` checkout the project lives inside); EGit is not required.
- `command` (**required**) - the git command, shell-style. A leading `git` is optional. Quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`) group an argument that contains spaces (e.g. a commit message); the string is **not** run through a shell, so shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `$`, backticks) are ordinary literals, never operators.

## Enabled on demand (off by default)
This tool is **disabled by default** because it is powerful (it can push, checkout, stash, ...). Enable it in **Window → Preferences → MCP Server → Tools** (it has its own **Git** group). Until then it is not advertised in `tools/list`. (It is disabled at the tool level, so `enable_toolset` - the progressive-disclosure mechanism - does not turn it on; use the Tools tab.)

## Authentication & config are the machine's (trust boundary)
There is deliberately **no** credential handling here. `git` uses whatever the machine running EDT is configured with - your `ssh-agent` key, a git credential helper, `~/.gitconfig` - exactly like the terminal you already use. The tool sets `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and `credential.interactive=false`, so a missing credential **fails fast** with git's own error instead of a terminal prompt or a credential-manager window. Credential URLs are also redacted from the tool's output (`https://***@host/...`), so a token already stored in the repository config is not handed back through MCP. The tool itself stores no secret; a `scheme://user:password@host` URL, an `https://<token>@host` one and a remote URL with a **query string** (`...repo.git?access_token=…`) are both **rejected** (it would be persisted in config and appear in the MCP request history) - use your credential helper or an ssh key. A plain `ssh://user@host/repo.git` (or `git+ssh://`) is NOT a credential and is accepted - that is git's documented SSH remote form.

**What is hardened vs. what is trusted.** The tool hardens against COMMAND-STRING injection: no shell, an allowlisted subcommand set, a denied set of program-running / file-writing / repo-redirecting options (matched by exact name, `=value`, AND abbreviation, since git resolves unique prefixes), rejection of `ext::`/`fd::` transport-helper and `user:password@` URLs, safe transports (`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`), and a scrubbed set of `GIT_*` redirection/exec variables. Because abbreviations are matched conservatively, a legitimate option that merely shares a prefix with a denied one may be over-rejected (e.g. `--con` for `--contains`); pass the full option name.

It does **not** sandbox the machine or the repository's own configuration: the `git` executable is resolved from the machine's `PATH`; a repository's hooks, filters, aliases and merge drivers run with your privileges; and operand paths are not confined to the work tree - **exactly as they would in your terminal**. Only enable this tool for a machine and repositories you already trust to run git in, as you do when you `cd` into them yourself.

## What this tool is - and what it is not

It is a **terminal-equivalent convenience**, not a sandbox. Enabling it grants git - and whatever the
repository's and the machine's configuration make git run (hooks, filters, credential helpers,
`core.sshCommand`, a pager) - the same authority the EDT user already has. That is the same authority
you give git when you type the command yourself, which is exactly the point.

What the tool **does** guarantee, and what the checks below are for:

- the command never reaches a **shell** - it is executed as an argument vector, so there is no
  command-injection surface in the string you send;
- only **whitelisted subcommands** run, and every write-capable one asks for consent;
- it never **hangs**: stdin is closed and the editor, pager, askpass, credential prompt and signing
  are all disabled, so anything that would wait for a human fails fast instead;
- one **bounded** process (see the timeout below): at the timeout it is killed together with every
  child the JVM can still see, and the output is capped. A child that a hook or helper fully
  DETACHES before we sample it is out of reach — Java has no portable process-group / job-object
  API, so descendants are tracked by sampling while git runs — but it holds neither the tool's
  thread nor its pipe afterwards.

The rest - the blocked-option list, the checks that keep a path inside the repository, and the
credential redaction in the output - are **best-effort guardrails against a common mistake**, not a
containment boundary. Git owns the option grammar (a value can be attached, clustered or abbreviated)
and the output format, so a determined caller, or a repository configured to run its own programs,
can work around them. Treat this tool as you would a terminal you handed to the agent: enable it for
repositories you trust, and rely on the consent gate for anything that writes.

## Supported subcommands (whitelist)
A minimal, deliberately-small set - inspection and the dev loop:
`add`, `blame`, `branch`, `checkout`, `cherry-pick`, `commit`, `describe`, `diff`, `fetch`, `log`, `ls-files`, `merge`, `pull`, `push`, `remote`, `restore`, `rev-parse`, `revert`, `show`, `stash`, `status`, `switch`, `tag`.

Anything else is **rejected** with an actionable error naming the supported set. Deliberately excluded: `config` (it can set `core.sshCommand`/aliases = arbitrary code), `clean` / `gc` / `reset` (irrecoverable data loss), `rebase` (its `--exec`/`-x` runs a command per step), `init` / `clone` (repository bootstrap is out of scope), `submodule` / `worktree` / `filter-branch` / `daemon` / `credential`.

Also rejected wherever they appear: the `--upload-pack` / `--receive-pack` / `--exec` remote/step-program options, the `--config` / `--config-env` inline-config, the `--git-dir` / `--work-tree` / `--exec-path` / `--namespace` repository redirections, and `--ext-diff` / `--output` / `--help` / `--no-index` (external driver / arbitrary file write / man viewer / reading files outside the repo), plus `--strategy` everywhere and a single-dash token that can carry `-s` on `merge`/`pull` - the cluster spells it too (`-nspwn` is `-n -s pwn`), while a value-taking letter ends it, so `-Xours` and `-mfixes` stay allowed, as do `cherry-pick -s`/`revert -s` (there `-s` is `--signoff`) (git runs the strategy as the program `git-<strategy>` from `PATH`; `-X`/`--strategy-option`, which only configures the built-in strategy, stays allowed), plus the options that take an arbitrary FILE as their value - `--contents` (`blame` prints it), `--file` / `-F` on `commit`/`tag`/`merge` (it lands in the message), `--template` and `--pathspec-from-file` - and any **global** option before the subcommand (e.g. `-c core.sshCommand=...`), since the first token must be a bare subcommand. Transports are restricted (`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`) to the safe set, so a `ext::` / `fd::` transport-helper remote (which would run an arbitrary command) is refused. A `file://` remote is refused too - git would read, and on a push WRITE, a repository anywhere on disk, and that path sits inside a URI where the repository-containment check cannot see it (a local remote written as a plain path is covered by that check).

## Result
JSON: `{ "success": <exit==0>, "exitCode": <n>, "command": "git ...", "output": "<combined stdout+stderr>" }`. A non-zero `exitCode` (a rejected push, a merge conflict, ...) is `success: false` with git's own message in `output` - never a false success. `output` is capped (`truncated: true` when it was cut). The op is bounded to 120 seconds; a stalled command is killed with a timeout error.

## Examples
```
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "command": "status" }
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "command": "diff HEAD~1" }
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "command": "commit -m \"fix: handle empty input\"" }
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "command": "push origin main" }
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "command": "pull origin main" }
```

## Notes & gotchas
- **Every write-capable subcommand asks first** (so a read-only form of one - `remote -v`, `branch --list`, `stash list` - prompts too). Only the read-only subcommands (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `blame`, `ls-files`, `rev-parse`, `describe`) run silently; every other subcommand goes through the server's destructive-consent gate (the same one `delete_metadata` uses). The rule is per SUBCOMMAND, not per flag, and deliberately coarse: whether a given `push`, `checkout` or `merge` destroys work depends on options git resolves per subcommand, with bundles (`-fq`), attached values (`-bfeature`) and accepted abbreviations (`--forc`) - classifying at that level both missed real forms (`push +main:main`, `merge --abort` discarding conflict resolutions) and prompted for safe ones. Under-asking loses work git cannot bring back; over-asking costs one click - or none, once you set the consent level in the MCP Server preferences (or `EDT_MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_CONSENT` at launch) for unattended use.
- **An ssh command you configured is respected.** When `core.sshCommand` or `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is set, the tool uses it as-is (your custom identity, port or wrapper keeps working); only when neither is configured does it install its own `ssh -oBatchMode=yes`. A GUI askpass is disabled either way, and the per-call timeout bounds a command that still waits.
- **`diff` cannot read outside the repository.** `--no-index` is rejected, and so is an operand that resolves outside the work tree (git applies the filesystem-compare form implicitly for such a path).
- **GPG signing is not available** (creating *or* verifying). Signing needs the gpg-agent pinentry dialog, which an unattended MCP session cannot answer, so every call runs with the signing config off and no usable `gpg.*program`: a signing request fails immediately with a git error instead of hanging. Because git uses the same programs to verify, `tag -v` / `--show-signature` / `--verify-signatures` do not report signatures here either - sign and verify from your terminal.
- **openWorldHint = true**: `push` / `pull` / `fetch` reach an external remote. The tool never opens or authenticates against a 1C infobase.
- Operates on the ON-DISK content. Save or `resync_to_disk` the EDT model before `commit` so your model edits are captured.
- The typed `list_git_branches` / `switch_git_branch` / `create_git_branch` tools remain available (and enabled) for branch work with 1C application binding; this `git` tool is the general-purpose escape hatch.
