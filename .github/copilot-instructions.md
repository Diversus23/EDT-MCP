## CRITICAL: Always Consult the Expert

**Before making any significant changes, ALWAYS use expert consultation tools:**

Tool	When Copilot Uses It
🧠 Ask Expert	- Clarifications, stuck after 2 attempts, architectural decisions
🎯 Select Options	- Present 2-5 choices for decisions
📝 Review Code	- Security-sensitive or complex implementations
⚠️ Confirm Action	- Before deletions, schema changes, breaking changes
🖼️ Read Image	- Analyze mockups, diagrams, icons in your project
📊 Check Task Status	- Get messages from expert, respect pause, check if consultation needed
📋 Questionnaire	- Multi-field forms for structured data collection

**When to consult:**
- Uncertain about BSL typing or 1C platform specifics
- Before modifying existing business logic
- When error messages are unclear
- Before any database schema changes
- When implementing new tools or integrations
